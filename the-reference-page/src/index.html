         Welcome to a short instructional page on how to use HTML.  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It was first seen in 1991 when it was first mentioned by Tim Berners-Lee under "HTML Tags". HTML is mainly a markup language that web browsers use to interpet and compose text, audio, images and more. 
        </p>
     <p> Here's a peak into the evolution of HTML!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>HTML 2:</b> First seen on November 24 1995.  Tables weren't introduced until May of 1996. Imagine not being able to create a table until a year later.  So unorgainized *faints*.</li> <br>
          <li><b>HTML 3:</b> We first saw this on January 14 of 1997.  One year after the best year most of man-kind has seen.  HTML3.2 was first published as a W3C Reccomendation. It was the first version developed adn stadardized by W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium).  HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas, and solved issues among various extensions. </li><br>
          <li><b>HTML 4:</b> This one has a lot of significant dates. On December 18th 1997, HTML 4.0 was published by W3C Reccomendation. It was initially code named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar"><u>Cougar</u></a>. It adopted browser elements and attributes, while phasing outNetscape visual mark-up. After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years.  This may be due to laziness, maybe, only God knows.</li><br>
          <li><b>HTML 5:</b> We've now come full circle.  I ("the creater" *he says in an english accent*) have been using this method of creation for about two weeks.  I'm not that good yet. If you can't do better, your opinion doesn't matter (in this case, in other cases it might #positivity).  HTML 5 was first published on October 28th, 2014.</li> </ul>
          <p> For more information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#History"><u>read a book!</u></a> </p>   </body>

       <!-- Getting Started-->
          <section class="main-section info" id="Getting_Started_With_HTML!"> <header>Getting Started with HTML!</header>
        <p>On this page you'll learn how to use HTML in a basic sense. I'll make it easy for you! You'll see how a normal HTML page is structured, and the language's features. We might even play with HTML a little!
            </p>
            <h3 id="Quals"> What you'll need to do this is:</h3>
            <ol> 
              <li> A good Attitude! We  don't need negative Nancys, or Nazis but that's a given.</li>
              <li> You need a brain. If you have one of these, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><u>click here!</u></a></li>
              <li> A computer! You  also have to know how to use it. you got here so you should be fine!</li>
            </ol>
            <p> To get started in HTML, lets try and easy peice of code. Enter this in the Code window!</p>
            <code>
              <p> Hello World!! :)</p>
            </code>
            <p> I wish you good luck as you start this journey young grasshopper. (*bows*)</p>

        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt= "an example of HTML code"> <br>
        <figcaption>
          Here is an example of how code looks! 
          </figcaption>
        <p>
          From the previous photo we can see that the main parts of code are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Opening Tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element enclosed in angled brackets.  This shows us where the element starts </li><br>
          <li><b>The Closing Tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends.  I copied this right the article "Getting Started with HTML", so it's not plagiarism, I think.  Don't tell the cops!</li><br>
          <li><b>The Content:</b> Basically what's in the element. </li><br>
           <li><b>The Element:</b> The whole package of the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content.  Simple like the famous Bahamian cuisine "chicken in the bag". It's literally just chicken in a bag, it's really good! </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> Try these code chucks, change them because plagiarism is a thing.  I'll know if you don't the Government monitors us all! If you doubt this, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KWK4WPS9rE"><u>play this!</u></a>
           If you're smart you'll get the reference.  If not refer to <a href="#Quals"><u>me!</u></a>. </p>
        <p> Anyway try these chunks!</p>
        <p>This chunk just has standard code!</p>
          <code>
              <p> Hello World: Part 2!! The Reckoning >:]</p>
            </code><br>
        <p> This one has some style.  Now your text is green!</p> 
        <code>
          style{
          p{color: green}
          }
              <p> Hello World: Part 2!! The Reckoning >:]</p>
            </code><br>
        
        <p>Some more fun! Now you'll be  changing the font!</p> 
        <code>
          style{
          p{color: green}
          font-family: "Brush Script MT"
          }
              <p> Hello World: Part 2!! The Reckoning >:]</p>
        </code><br>
        <p>Now the clincher!</p> 
        <code>
          style{
          p{color: green}
          font-family: "Brush Script
          MT"
          font-size: 200px;
          }
              <p> Hello World: Part 2!! The Reckoning >:]</p>
        </code>

    <!--Attributes--> 
        <section class="main-section start info" id="Attributes"> <header> Attributes</header>
          <p> Today we'll just be going through some simple attributes. Here's a photo example!</p>
          
          <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"> <br>
        <figcaption>
          Here is how attribute code looks! </figcaption>
          <p> Attributes are totally cool.  They can totally change the dynamic of the projects that you work! Here are some fun examples of attributes: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> You can add an anchor (a) to your project to not only link different pages, but also different parts of your pages to your project. Very fun! </li><br>
            <li> You can also use boolean attributes.  These attributes allow you to see when certain criteria is active.  I can really spruce things up!</li><br>
            </ul>

   <!--References-->
